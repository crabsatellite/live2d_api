Steps for using your own Minecraft skin:
1. View "guide.png" as it explains which part is which.
2. Use "reference.png" as your reference on where to replace the eyes.
3. Copy the eyes and eyelashes on top of the reference.
4. Cover the eyes with skin color.
5. Scale the texture from 64x64 to 4096x4096 with Nearest Neighbor (should be pixelated, not blurry).
6. Save it as "texture_00.png" in the "Minecraft Live2D.4096" folder
7. In Live2D, if you see a white outline to the second layer, go to:
Settings > Third Icon from Top Left > Fix White Outlines

FAQ:
Why is the bottom of the head pixelated?
- It's the clipping mask... If you want it to be less pixelated, go to:
Settings > Second Icon from Top Left > Quality and Effects > Live2D Mask Config and
turn on "Smooth Live2D Masks" press configure and choose "8192 x 8192 pixels (max. 64 masks)"
- But if it's lagging for you, do turn it back to default or pick a lower number.

How do I edit the eyes' type / position?
- The circle buttons on the right, each button does something... Go ahead and click em!

My skin has Alex arms, is it supported?
- Yes! You can change the type of arm by clicking the fifth circle button on the right side.

How can I disable the face?
- You can disable the face by clicking the first circle button on the right side.

Does the model sneak / crouch?
- Yup! By default, it's set to Shift button, but if you want to change it to something else, it's in Settings > Fourth Icon from Top Left > Scroll down to "Sneak / Crouch Button" and change

Does the model jump?
- Yes it also does! It's set to nothing by default, so you have to set the binding in the same place mentioned in the previous FAQ.

How do I activate the death animation?
- By default, it's set to the bottom most button on the right side. If you don't want it to be that button, you can change it in the binding.

The mouth is being covered by the second layer, is there a way to show the mouth on top of it?
- You can press the sixth button on the right side to have the mouth shown on top.
